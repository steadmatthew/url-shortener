# steadmatthew/URL-Shortener
This is my shitty url shortener, feel free to use it anywhere you want (why tho?)
## Config
mongoURI (string (REQUIRED)) is the URL that you connect to mongo with
port (number (default: 8080)) is the port that the webserver listens on
check (boolean (default: false)) decides if the server checks if the URL is already in the database when you create
## Setup
Fill in your config file
Rename your config to config.json
## Improvement
The frontend really needs improvement.
The backend also really needs improvement.
Basically I'm saying you'd have to be a nutjob to use this as is in prod.
## Contribution
Just make a pull request and I will review it eventually!
